## 💡 Inspiration

My cousins and I love going out to eat together, but sometimes one person ends up paying upfront. Everyone is shy about reminding others to pay them back. That's why I built Nudge – a friendly way to track shared expenses and make sure everyone gets their fair share without the awkward conversations!
